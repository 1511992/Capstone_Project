EMBT is a core Embedded System Design Course which provides us all the theoretical as well as practical knowledge of the embedded technology. So far, we have learnt alot of things related to hardware and software. Last semester we had subjects like Embedded System Architecture II, Embedded System Communication Protocol ans Security, Embedded Real Time Operating System in which we learnt so many things like interfacing Beaglebone and Arduino using linux operating system, also UART, SPI, I2C communication and many more, we worked on the softwares like Eclipse, MCUXpresso and QT Creator; so all this helps us to built on our knowledge to design and implement complete embedded applications.
So in this semester we will try to implement all the knowledge that we gained from last semesters accordingly on our project.
