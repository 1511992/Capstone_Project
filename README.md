EMBT is a core Embedded System Design Course which provides us all the theoretical as well as practical knowledge of the embedded technology. So far, we have learnt alot of things related to hardware and software. Last semester we had subjects like Embedded System Architecture II in which we built on our knowledge to design and implement complete embedded applications.
